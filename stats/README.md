Scripts for calculating the coverage of the input sequences and the average column identity score in a MAF file. Coverage is the fraction of input sequences included in the alignment. The column identity score is defined as the percentage of identical nucleotide pairs in a column of an alignment block.
### Usage
```
python coverage.py <input_maf>
python avg_identity_score.py <input_maf>
```
